So, at CodeHelp we are here to provide all the necessary counsel you might need for placement preparations, interview experiences, programming, et cetera! For any additional questions, feel free to email us at tharishithpurini@gmail.com

<h1>Our Story</h1>
<div> At TharSha, we aim to provide new students with proper mentorship and education for their learning and growth.
</div>
<div>
TharSha was founded in 2020 by Shashank and Tharshith (Ex-Amazon, Ex-Microsoft) to deliver “to the point, short and practical” educational content for learning programming, coding, and preparing for job placements, and interviews. He has been mentoring students through his Youtube channel which has now gained more than 17 million views and is now looking forward to providing his guidance in different courses through TharSha.
</div><h1>  Our Instructor </h1>
<div>
    A mentor is someone confident enough with their experiences and knowledge in a particular topic or set of topics, to comfortably assist others with less experience or knowledge.

 <h1>  About  Course </h1>
  <div>
This course is designed to start you on a path toward future studies in web development and design, no matter how little experience or technical knowledge you currently have. The web is a very big place, and if you are the typical internet user, you probably visit several websites every day, whether for business, entertainment or education. But have you ever wondered how these websites actually work? How are they built? How do browsers, computers, and mobile devices interact with the web? What skills are necessary to build a website? With almost 1 billion websites now on the internet, the answers to these questions could be your first step toward a better understanding of the internet and developing a new set of internet skills.  
  </div>
  <div>
By the end of this course you’ll be able to describe the structure and functionality of the world wide web, create dynamic web pages using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, apply essential programming language concepts when creating HTML forms, select an appropriate web hosting service, and publish your webpages for the world to see. Finally, you’ll be able to develop a working model for creating your own personal or business websites in the future and be fully prepared to take the next step in a more advanced web development or design course or specialization.
